# Shibboleth-vagrant
Vagrant box - Shibboleth IdP3 + SP 2.x testing environment

Shibboleth SP / IdP are almost on factory settings. ~~So IdP wont release any attributes to the SP.~~ IdP will release couple of attributes to the Shibboleth SP (uid, mail, sn, cn, givenName)

## Prereqs
* Virtualbox (or other vagrant compliant virtualization "engine")

## This Vagrant box includes following packages / applications:
* CentOS 7
* httpd 2.2
* Oracle Java 8
* Tomcat 8.0.30
* Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) 2.5.x
* Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP) 3.2.0
* OpenLDAP
* phpLdapAdmin

+ Google Authenticator module:  
https://github.com/korteke/Shibboleth-IdP3-TOTP-Auth  

All programs are provisioned to vagrant box with [Ansible](https://www.google.com)

# Installation

Before you can run this box you need to install Vagrant and Ansible to your host computer:
### Ansible

#### Mac
* https://valdhaus.co/writings/ansible-mac-osx/

#### Linux
* http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html

#### Windows (Not tested) w\ cygwin
* https://servercheck.in/blog/running-ansible-within-windows
EDIT:
Tested with these instructions + (https://github.com/geerlingguy/JJG-Ansible-Windows/blob/master/windows.sh), but nogo.
I will investigate this later
- Founded way to tackle this problem. Will test and push changes.

### Vagrant
* http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads

# Configuration

You need to add Vagrant box ip address to the hosts-file (linux /etc/hosts, windows c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts)

```
192.168.0.120 vagrant.local
```

# Usage

* Execute "vagrant up" and wait that the ansible run has completed, expected outcome:

```
PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
default                    : ok=50   changed=48   unreachable=0    failed=0
```

Open browser and navigate to the address "https://vagrant.local/secure/" this URL is secured with Shibboleth SP, so that will redirect you to the Shibboleth IdP where you need to authenticate.

You can use following users to test this setup:
* johnd / Password1
* janed / Password1  

Google Authenticator flow can be tested with URL: https://vagrant.local/Shibboleth.sso/totp  or https://vagrant.local/Shibboleth.sso/totp?target=/secure  
Latter URL will redirect you to the so simple PHP-site where you can see your attributes & headers.

Google Authenticator seed  for "johnd" = G24YUKCHHXRDWCPR

After authentication you will be redirected back to https://vagrant.local/secure/. There is a simple PHP site which will show your environment variables and http headers.

# Manage
You can use phpLdapAdmin application to manage users that are allowed to authenticate. It can be found https://vagrant.local/ldapadmin. Authenticate with user: "cn=manager,dc=vagrant,dc=local" password: "Password1"
